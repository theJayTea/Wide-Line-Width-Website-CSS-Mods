# Wide-Line-Width-Website-CSS-Mods
I hate that text on most websites only sits in the middle 30% of my screens, leaving incredible amounts of whitespace (&amp; making it harder to skim!).

This is a collection of CSS scripts I wrote after prodding with Inspect Element to reverse-engineer how the line widths were implemented on websites I use often.

Apply these with Stylus, Hyperweb, etc.
